# Deep Learning Workbook

The Jupyter notebook [deep-learning-workbook.ipynb](./deep-learning-workbook.ipynb) outlines a universal blueprint that can be used to attack and solve any machine learning problem. It is based on the workflow described in the book [Deep Learning with Python](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python).

### Usage Instructions

1. Set up your dev environment with [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/), [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) & [Keras](https://keras.io/) (or any other ML framework of your choice). Follow [this guide](https://blog.keras.io/running-jupyter-notebooks-on-gpu-on-aws-a-starter-guide.html) if you wish to use a GPU on AWS.

2. Download this workbook using the command:
```bash
wget https://bit.ly/deep-learning-workbook-raw
```

3. Change the file name, title and kernel as desired. This notebook was originally written with the kernel `conda:tensorflow_p36` on the [AWS Deep Learning AMI](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B01M0AXXQB).

4. Follow the steps described in the notebook, filling in the blanks marked as `TODO`.

5. Once you're done building the final model, you can delete the cells containing instructions.
